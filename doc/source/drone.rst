Drone
*****************
The drone a.k.a "Ugglan" (Swedish for owl) is a DIY build
quadcopter, using the Raspberry Pi Zero.

Some in-depth parts of the Modeling, State Estimation and Control
are not covered in this document, for details see the arthur's master thesis
`Design, Modeling and Control of an Octocopter <http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:857660/FULLTEXT01.pdf>`_.

Software
=================

Tasks
---------------
The drone's top level software design can be seen as a task manager, (asynchronous
and synchronous) solving the producer and consumer problem. Where the producers are
the sensors (IMU, ESC etc.). And where the control loop, data logging etc. are
the consumers, see :numref:`drone_sw_design`.

        EscRead -- push 5 Hz --> DataLogQueue
        RcReceiver -- push 50 Hz --> DataLogQueue

        DataLogQueue -- last value 50 Hz --> StateControl
        DataLogQueue -- last value 50 Hz --> EscWrite
        DataLogQueue -- pop 100 Hz --> DataLogger

        end

        subgraph Consumers
        StateControl
        EscWrite
        DataLogger
        end

As one can see, the ``DataLogQueue`` maintains a thread safe queue for the producers to
push to and the ``DataLogger`` to pop from. But it also stores the last (pushed) sample
for consumers to use e.g., the ``StateControl`` which runs at a constant execution/sample
rate i.e. to simplify the signal processing. Note, other tasks than producers may populate
the queue e.g., estimated states which are useful for offline tuning of control laws.

Note, some signals such as the ones from the pressure sensor will only be sampled
at 10 Hz. This has to be handled by the state controller.

Data Logging
-----------------
The ``DataLogger`` handles the data serialization of signals e.g., the IMU acceleration
which is continuously written to disk. It consists of a **HEADER** section - a json string,
describing the content of the second **DATA PACKAGES** section. See :numref:`data_log_protocol`
for an illustration of the data-log protocol.

.. _data_log_protocol:
.. figure:: figures/data_log_protocol.svg
    :width: 100%

    The data logging protocol. The **SIGNAL ID** is an unique identifer for each signal/package
    and of type ``uint16``. The **REL TIMESTAMP** is the relative timestamp in ms
    between each **PACKAGE** and of type ``uint8``.

The json-file is compressed using gzip (and base64 encoded) to save space. See example
header below.

.. _devices_and_busses:

Devices & Busses
-----------------
The IMU's and ESC's are communicating with the Pi over i2c. The IMU can run at 400 kHz (fast mode)
and is using the built-in HW. But, the ESC's only run stable at 100 kHz (normal mode) and are
therefore using a SW implementation (i2c-gpio overlay, bit-banging over GPIO 23-24). The RC receiver
is communicating over UART, a serial connection. See overview in :numref:`connected_busses`.

Modeling
===============

.. _drone_multi_body:
.. figure:: figures/drone_multi_body.svg
    :width: 100%

    Multi body analysis of the drone.

Nomenclature
------------------
:math:`_{I}` Inertial reference frame

:math:`_{B}` Body reference frame

Inertia
------------------
Using multi body analysis of the drone and its components, the total drone
(mass and moments) inertia is estimated, see :numref:`drone_multi_body`.
This results in the following inertia estimates

.. math::

    I_{est} =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0.014 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & 0.014 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & 0.026
    \end{bmatrix} \text{kgm}^2

and :math:`m_{est}=1.038` kg. For comparison, the measured weight is :math:`m_{meas}=1058` kg.
Also its center of mass w.r.t the top frame is located at :math:`CM_{est}=[0, -0.001, -0.006]` m.
Hence, a rather good weight distribution.

Motor Dynamics
------------------
The motor dynamics, :math:`u_{M_i}\rightarrow\omega_{M_iz}` are modelled as a simple first order
LTL system (low-pass filter)

.. math::

    \Omega_{M_iz}(s) = \frac{1}{\tau s + 1}U_{M_i}(s)

where :math:`\tau` is the time constant. The time constant can be estimated by analyzing the
systems step response. By assuming :math:`\omega_{M_i}(0) = \omega_0` and
:math:`\omega_{M_i}(\infty) = \omega_1`, before and after the step response as settled, one gets

.. math::

    \omega_{M_i}(t) = \omega_1 + (\omega_0 - \omega_1) e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}

which can be re-written as

.. math::

    \ln(\omega_{M_i}(t) - \omega_1) = \ln(\omega_0 - \omega_1) - \tau^{-1} t.

By then measuring :math:`\omega_{M_i}` and :math:`t` one can estimate :math:`\tau` by using least
squares regression. Note, the time constant should be estimated separately for positive and negative
steps.

TODO: Estimation of time constant using an empirical study.

State Estimation
=================

Attitude Estimation
--------------------
For attitude control, the Euler angles :math:`\eta = [\phi, \theta, \psi]` and their respective
time derivatives (angular rates) :math:`\dot{\eta} = \omega` (in the linearized model) are
needed.

Here :math:`\omega` is simply given by the IMU's gyro, but :math:`\eta` has to be estimated. This
can be accomplished using all sensors (accelerometer, gyro and magnetometer) and is a common
problem. Without going into detail - geometrical relationships yield

.. math::

    \phi_{acc} &= \text{atan2}(-a_{By}, -a_{Bz}) \\
    \theta_{acc} &= \text{atan2}(a_{Bx}, \sqrt{a_{By}^2 + a_{Bz}^2}) \\
    \psi_{mag} &= \text{atan2}(-B_{Iy}, B_{Ix})

where

.. math::

    B_{Ix} &= B_{Bx}\cos(\theta) + B_{By}\sin(\phi)\sin(\theta) + B_{Bz}\sin(\theta)\cos(\phi) \\
    B_{Iy} &= B_{By}\cos(\phi) - B_{Bz}\sin(\phi)

and :math:`a_B` is the acceleration and :math:`B_B` is the earths magnetic field supplied by the
IMU in the body frame. Where :math:`B_{Ix}` and :math:`B_{Iy}` are the magnetic fields in the
inertial frame.

These estimates can be improved by using the gyro and a simple first order complementary
filter (see `IMU Data Fusing <http://www.olliw.eu/2013/imu-data-fusing/>`_)

.. math::

    \tilde{\phi}^{k} &= \text{cf}(\phi_{acc}^k, \dot{\phi}_{gyro}^k, \tilde{\phi}^{k-1}, \tau_{\phi}) \\
    \tilde{\theta}^{k} &= \text{cf}(\theta_{acc}^k, \dot{\theta}_{gyro}^k, \tilde{\theta}^{k-1}, \tau_{\theta}) \\
    \tilde{\psi}^{k} &= \text{cf}(\psi_{mag}^k, \dot{\psi}_{gyro}^k, \tilde{\psi}^{k-1}, \tau_{\psi})

where

.. math::

    y^{k} &= \text{cf}(u^k, \dot{u}^k, y^{k-1}, \tau) \\
            &= \alpha(y^{k-1} + \dot{u}^k\Delta t) + (1-\alpha)u^k

where :math:`\alpha = \tfrac{\tau}{\tau + \Delta t}` and :math:`\tau` is the cut-off frequency
(:math:`\tau = \tfrac{1}{2 \pi f_c}`). Note that the estimates also need range limiting
(module of angles) and offset compensation (gyro and hard iron).

In :numref:`attitude_estimation` the result of the attitude estimation is shown. Note the large
drift of the gyro.

.. _attitude_estimation:
.. figure:: figures/attitude_estimation.svg
    :width: 100%

    Attitude estimation of roll (:math:`\phi`), pitch (:math:`\theta`) and
    yaw (:math:`\psi`). Both unfiltered and complementary filter estimates.
    Here :math:`\tau_{\phi}=\tau_{\theta}=\tau_{\psi}` s.t. :math:`f_c=20` Hz.

Hard Iron Offset
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Magnetic fields affecting the magnetometer other than earth's need to be compensated
for. One of those is hard iron (the other being soft iron) effects. These are static
magnetic fields e.g., components on the PCB.

These offsets can easily be estimated using least squares (offset of a sphere)

.. math::

    \underset{V}{\text{minimize}} (B-V)^T (B-V) = B^2.

To get a good estimate, the magnetometer should be rotated in space to excite all
directions, see :numref:`hard_iron_offset`.

State Control
-----------------
TODO: Summary of master thesis work.

Motor Control
------------------
The body force and torque control inputs :math:`u_{Bz}`, :math:`u_{B\phi}`,
:math:`u_{B\theta}` and :math:`u_{B\psi}` have to be converted to individual
motor control inputs :math:`u_{M_i}`.

.. _motor_rotations:
.. figure:: figures/motor_rotations.svg
    :width: 75%

    The drone motor rotational directions.

From :numref:`motor_rotations` one can derive the drone body forces and
torques generated by the motors

.. math::

    f_{Bx} &= 0 \\
    f_{By} &= 0 \\
    f_{Bz} &= - f_{M_1z} - f_{M_2} - f_{M_3} - f_{M_4z} \\
    m_{Bx} &= - l_xf_{M_1z} - l_xf_{M_2z} + l_xf_{M_3z} + l_xf_{M_4z} \\
    m_{By} &=   l_xf_{M_1z} - l_xf_{M_2z} - l_xf_{M_3z} + l_xf_{M_4z} \\
    m_{Bz} &= - m_{M_1z} + m_{M_2z} - m_{M_3z} + m_{M_4z}

where :math:`f_{M_ix} = f_{M_iy} = m_{M_ix} = m_{M_iy} = 0` and
:math:`l_x = 0.23` [m] (distance between body center of mass and motor).

In order to solve for the motor inputs one can use the fact that
:math:`f, m \propto \omega^2`, where :math:`\omega` is the angular rate of a
motor/propeller, see :numref:`ang_rate_sq_vs_thrust`.

.. _ang_rate_sq_vs_thrust:
.. figure:: figures/ang_rate_sq_vs_thrust.svg
    :width: 100%

    Motor angular rate and its corresponding generated thrust. Positive
    rotation corresponds to the "intended" propeller rotation i.e., not
    driven in reverse. Fitted a 1st-order polynomial :math:`y = X[p_1]^\intercal`.

Hence, the generated body forces and torques can be described as following

.. math::

    \begin{bmatrix}
        f_{Bz} \\
        m_{Bx} \\
        m_{By} \\
        m_{Bz}
    \end{bmatrix} =
    \underbrace{
        \begin{bmatrix}
            -c_{fz} & -c_{fz} & -c_{fz} & -c_{fz} \\
            -l_xc_{fz} & -l_xc_{fz} & l_xc_{fz} & l_xc_{fz} \\
            l_xc_{fz} & -l_xc_{fz} & -l_xc_{fz} & l_xc_{fz} \\
            -c_{mz} & c_{mz} & -c_{mz} & c_{mz}
        \end{bmatrix}
    }_H
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \omega_{M_1z}^2 \\
        \omega_{M_2z}^2 \\
        \omega_{M_3z}^2 \\
        \omega_{M_4z}^2
    \end{bmatrix}.


By computing :math:`H^{-1}` one gets

.. math::

    [\omega_{M_1z}^2, \omega_{M_2z}^2, \omega_{M_3z}^2, \omega_{M_4z}^2]^\intercal
    = H^{-1} [f_{Bz}, m_{Bx}, m_{By}, m_{Bz}]^\intercal

where

.. math::
    H^{-1} = \frac{1}{4}
        \begin{bmatrix}
            -\tfrac{1}{c_{fz}} & -\tfrac{1}{l_xc_{fz}} & \tfrac{1}{l_xc_{fz}} & -\tfrac{1}{c_{mz}} \\
            -\tfrac{1}{c_{fz}} & -\tfrac{1}{l_xc_{fz}} & -\tfrac{1}{l_xc_{fz}} & \tfrac{1}{c_{mz}} \\
            -\tfrac{1}{c_{fz}} & \tfrac{1}{l_xc_{fz}} & -\tfrac{1}{l_xc_{fz}} & -\tfrac{1}{c_{mz}} \\
            -\tfrac{1}{c_{fz}} & \tfrac{1}{l_xc_{fz}} & \tfrac{1}{l_xc_{fz}} & \tfrac{1}{c_{mz}}
        \end{bmatrix}.

From :numref:`ang_rate_sq_vs_thrust` it can be seen that :math:`c_{fz}` is smaller (about half)
when the motor is reversing (negative rotation). This is probably due to the non-symmetrical
shape of the propeller. Hence, a non-linearity arises and :math:`H^{-1}` can't solely be used.
Therefore reversing will for now not be used, maybe in the future.

Anyhow, :numref:`ang_rate_sq_vs_thrust` also gives :math:`c_{fz} = -8.37\times 10^{-6}` (positive rotation
from now on only). The torque constant is given by :math:`c_{mz} = \tfrac{1}{50} c_{fz}` - empirical
relation from the master thesis.

In :numref:`ang_rate_vs_command` the empirical relation between the raw motor
control inputs and the angular rates is given.

.. _ang_rate_vs_command:
.. figure:: figures/ang_rate_vs_command.svg
    :width: 100%

    The motor angular rates and raw control inputs. Fitted a 1nd-order polynomial
    :math:`y = X[p_1, p_0]^\intercal`. Note, first 5 values are not included in the
    regression for a better fit - not a commonly used interval. Also note the
    symmetry about :math:`u`.

Hence, the final conversion is given by

.. math::
    u_{M_i} =
    \begin{cases}
        57\omega_{M_iz} - 9675 & \text{if } \omega_{M_iz} > 0 \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}.

Note, :math:`u_{M_i}` should also be range limited since is it a ``int16`` and reversing
is not used.
